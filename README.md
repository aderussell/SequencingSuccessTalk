# Sequencing Success

## Examples

### Counter to Ten
[Source](Sources/Examples/CounterToTenExample.swift)

A simple Sequence/Collection which shows how to create a simple custom `Sequence` to count from 1 to 10 and then conform it to `Collection`, `BidirectionalCollection` and `RandomAccessCollection`


### Alphabet
[Source](Sources/Examples/AlphabetExample.swift)

A very simple Collection which returns all the letters of the lower-case Roman alphabet, each as a `Character`.
This is similar to the 'Counter To Ten' example but has a different Element type to its Index to make the distinction clearer


### File Structure
[Source](Sources/Examples/FileStructureExample.swift)

An example of using the `RecursiveSequence` to perform operations on a recursive structure representing files & folers in a file system.


### Messages
[Source](Sources/Examples/MessagesExample.swift)

An approximation of the messages example from the '[Meet the Swift Algorithms and Collections packages](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10256)' WWDC 2021 talk.

### Spirograph
[Source](Sources/Examples/FileStructureExample.swift)

Using `UnfoldSequence` to create spirograph patterns.

### Theme Park
[Source](Sources/Examples/ThemeParkExample.swift)

Chaining a number of sequence extension methods to find rides which people of specified heights can ride.
